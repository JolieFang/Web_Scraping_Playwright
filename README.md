# Web_Scraping_Playwright
The project utilized Playwright for performing web scraping of monthly visitor data from websites in a headless mode on a Linux server. The implementation was containerized within a Docker container to provide increased efficiency and scalability. To make the scraped data easily accessible, a Flask web server was integrated to serve the data through HTTP requests.
